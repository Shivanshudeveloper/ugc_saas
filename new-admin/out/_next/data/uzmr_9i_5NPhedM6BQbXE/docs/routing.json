If you create a nested folder structure files will be automatically routed in the same way still.\r\n\r\n- `pages/blog/first-post.js` → `/blog/first-post`\r\n- `pages/dashboard/settings/username.js` → `/dashboard/settings/username`\r\n\r\n## Dynamic route segments\r\n\r\nDefining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications. In Next.js\r\nyou can add brackets to a page ([param]) to create a dynamic route (a.k.a. url slugs, pretty urls, \r\nand others).\r\n\r\nTo match a dynamic segment you can use the bracket syntax. This allows you to match named parameters.\r\n\r\n- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug` (`/blog/hello-world`)\r\n- `pages/[username]/settings.js` → `/:username/settings` (`/foo/settings`)\r\n- `pages/post/[...all].js` → `/post/*` (`/post/2020/id/title`)\r\n","slug":"routing","title":"Routing"}},"__N_SSG":true}
