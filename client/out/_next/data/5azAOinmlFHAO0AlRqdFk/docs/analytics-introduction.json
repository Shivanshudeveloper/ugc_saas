This may apply\r\nto your business, and you can find an example in the app.\r\n\r\n## Google Tag Manager (GTM)\r\n\r\nIn previous versions the app used `Google Analytics` directly, but for this version it uses GTM.\r\nThis enables a lot more control over the analytics implementation and also helps you display things\r\nlike GDPR modal, various targeted content; control the data transfer, cookies and other aspects\r\nbased on user data privacy preferences. Read more about GTM\r\n[here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en&ref_topic=3441530).\r\n\r\n## How GTM it works\r\n\r\nIn order to use the `GTM platform` you set up a container, then you create a tag for each provider\r\nyou need, for example, Google Analytics. Then, using the triggers, you control multiple tags based\r\non data pushed to the data layer. The data pushed gets computed on the client (browser), and then\r\nthe library determines which tags will be loaded.\r\n\r\n## How is it implemented\r\n\r\nThe app uses a small singleton class to help with loading the `GTM library`, initialize it and track\r\nevents via the GTM available methods.\r\n","slug":"analytics-introduction","title":"Analytics Introduction"}},"__N_SSG":true}
