In the project files you'll find a file `.env.example` that contains all the\r\nenvironment variables that were used in the app environment. **Not all are required.**\r\n\r\n## Loading Environment Variables\r\n\r\nNext.js has built-in support for loading environment variables from `.env` file into `process.env`.\r\n\r\nAn example `.env`:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nDB_HOST=localhost\r\nDB_USER=myuser\r\nDB_PASS=mypassword\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis loads `process.env.DB_HOST`, `process.env.DB_USER`, and `process.env.DB_PASS` into the Node.js \r\nenvironment automatically allowing you to use them in Next.js data fetching methods and API routes.\r\n\r\nFor example, using `getStaticProps`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// pages/index.js\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  const db = await myDB.connect({\r\n    host: process.env.DB_HOST,\r\n    username: process.env.DB_USER,\r\n    password: process.env.DB_PASS,\r\n  });\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser\r\n\r\nBy default environment variables are only available in the Node.js environment, meaning they won't\r\nbe exposed to the browser.\r\n\r\nIn order to expose a variable to the browser you have to prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. \r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nNEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk\r\n```\r\n\r\n> WARNING: Do not store any secrets (such as private API keys or passwords) in the public variables!\r\n> These environment variables are embedded into the build, meaning anyone can view them by \r\n> inspecting your app's files.\r\n\r\n## Private Variables\r\n\r\nHaving access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\r\n  analytics.disable();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead more about environment\r\nvariables [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).\r\n","slug":"environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables"}},"__N_SSG":true}
